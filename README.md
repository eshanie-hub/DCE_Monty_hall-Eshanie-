<h1>Monty Hall Problem</h1>
This web application is building using javasccript and bootstrap. The appilication let's the user input a number to iterate how many times the game should run, it also let's the user decide whether to switch doors or to stay with the chosen door. These are all done before starting the game. To start the user then press the Run simulations button which will output how many times the game ran what strategies were chosen and how many games were lost and won using that method.
